    "description": "At CIT we accept students based on their desire to achieve, and not by technical aptitude testing. CIT seeks students who are willing to pay the price of achievement by confronting adversity, mastering their fears, and achieving success through hard work, discipline and perseverance. We will reach out to anyone willing to learn how to become tech innovators and help them bring out their potential. “You can measure a person’s IQ, but you can’t measure the size of their heart. How bad do you want to win?”",
